# Food-spoilage-detection

Overview:
The application of the Food Spoilage Detection System is to check when gases enter stored food and notify whether it is safe to consume. This project uses an Arduino microcontroller and a gas sensor to detect the smell of spoiled food, providing real-time notifications and information about our food.

Working principle:
The Food Spoilage Detection System continuously monitors the surroundings of stored food for gases that indicate spoilage. As food begins to rot, it emits specific gases detectable by the gas sensor. The Arduino processes this data to determine if the gas concentration has surpassed a predetermined value, indicating food spoilage.
- Gas Detection: The gas sensor continuously monitors the level of spoilage-related gases in the air. When the detected gas levels exceed your defined threshold, it indicates food spoilage. The Arduino then uses a piezo buzzer to alert the user that the food is spoiled and needs replacement.
- Display System: The LCD display shows a warning message when spoilage is detected.

System Operation:
1. Initialization: The Arduino initializes the gas sensor, piezo buzzer, and LCD display when powered on.
2. Data Acquisition: The gas sensor constantly measures the gases present in its surrounding environment.
3. Data Processing: The measured gas levels are compared with the preset spoilage thresholds using Arduino.
4. Alert Activation: If the gas levels exceed this threshold, indicating spoiled food, the Arduino activates the piezo buzzer and updates the LCD display with a warning message.
5. Alerts: Spoilage detection is clearly notified on the LCD display.

Applications:
- Home Use: Monitors the freshness of food in refrigerators or pantries to prevent spoilage due to poor storage.
- Food Industry: Used in food storage and processing facilities to maintain the hygiene and quality of food.
- Grocery Stores: Helps track the perishability of goods and prevent spoilage, reducing financial loss.

Advantages:
- Early Detection: Helps identify spoiled food in time, preventing health hazards.
- User-Friendly: Provides real-time alerts with a clear LCD display.
- Affordable: Uses easily available components.
- Adjustable: Thresholds can be set for different kinds of foodstuffs and storage conditions.
